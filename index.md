# [Introduction](#Introduction)

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI), frequent in Parkinson Disease (PD), is a well-known risk factor for dementia. Nevertheless, MCI key network changes are still mostly unknown. Functional connectivity resting state networks (RSNs), such as the default mode, dorsal attention, executive control and sensorimotor networks, have been reported to correlated with cognitive deficits in PD. This study investigates how whole-brain functional networks are affected by MCI in PD using a Connectome ICA (connICA) analysis with resting state functional MRI (RS-fMRI).

**Figure 1: 87 participants (26 PDCN and 33 PD-MCI and 28 HC) were recruited and scanned in Siemens Trio 3T MR scanner with 32 channel head coils. After motion based censoring, 21 HC, 21 PDCN and, 23 PD-MCI subjects remained. A battery of neuropsychological tests was taken by each individual to diagnose PD-MCI according to MDS task force guidelines (level II) [¹]. PD patients were under anti-parkinsonian medication during the study.
